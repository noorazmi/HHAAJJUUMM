This is difficult but more rewarding.\n\n 2.<b>Tamattu</b>:\n The pilgrim wears Ihraam with the sole intention of Umrah. After its completion, the Ihraam is removed and another Ihraam is worn before 8th Dhul Hijjah for Hajj.\n\n 3.<b>Ifraad</b>:\n The pilgrim, intending Hajj only, enters the state of Ihraam.
